## 🚀 Project Overview

The system enables patients, doctors, and administrators to interact through secure APIs supporting scheduling, booking, and analytics workflows.

Key engineering goals:

- Scalable architecture supporting high consultation volume
- Reliable and concurrency-safe booking workflow
- Secure access using RBAC and JWT authentication
- Observable and audit-ready backend design
- Containerized deployment using Docker
